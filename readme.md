This is a Authentication System created as part of GHSRM Backend task.
## Task
Make an Authentication system using any backend framework (Node.js and Express or Django, etc.) with the user credentials saved in an SQL or a NoSQL Database.


## Guidelines Followed

1. **Proper Naming Conventions:** I've followed consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase to make it easy to understand and maintain.

2. **Proper Folder Structure:** My project maintains a clear and organized folder structure, enhancing scalability and code management.

3. **HTTP Status Codes:** I've ensured that the appropriate HTTP status codes are used for all API responses, improving communication between the server and clients.

4. **Input Validation:** Input validation is implemented to enhance security and prevent malicious input.

## Bonus Security Features

1. **JWT Validation:** I've integrated JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication, ensuring that user sessions are managed securely.

2. **Password Hashing:** Passwords are securely hashed before storage, providing an additional layer of protection against data breaches.
